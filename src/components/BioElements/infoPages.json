    "AboutUsBlurb":"Neo Pyrite is a Splatoon-oriented content crew with a goal of spreading laughs wherever we go. Most of us met while playing for Fool's Gold, a low-level Splatoon team that started in February 2023. After a year of competing and a bevy of roster changes, Fool's Gold formally disbanded in April of this year. Later that month, a group of former FG members would get together and begin laying the framework for Neo Pyrite. We wanted to use our diverse set of skills to create something indicative of our appreciation for not only Splatoon, but each other. So, that's where we're at now. Stay tuned and don't stop giggling!"
