I started playing Splatoon competitively around the beginning of last year with Fool's Gold, but I dabbled in games like Pokémon Unite and Super Smash Bros before that. Stamper is my one true love though I always look forward to experimenting and learning about the game through different lenses. Other than that, I’m a big fan of RPGs and love reading manga and whatnot. I'm really glad that I'm able to work on this project with The Fools and I can't wait to see what we whip up going forward.",
